## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Files

After cloning the repository, extract the env.zip file you received alongside this project. It contains two folders:

env.zip
├── backend/
│   └── .env
└── client/
    └── .env

Move the .env files into the corresponding folders in your cloned repository and replcae MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING in the backend `.env`.
The server will run on port 8181 by default, if you wish to change that edit VITE_BACKEND_PORT in both `.env` files.

### 2. Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 3. Frontend Setup

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```
